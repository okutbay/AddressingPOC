# AddressingPOC
I created this code as a project manager to demonstrate developers how it works for Trenkwalder Stocktaking Operation.

Address the locations in store, warehouse etc. with multiple dimesions (segments) for stocktaking or warehouse management operations.

Gives ability to create 4 segmented alphanumeric addresses with variable seperator char. Each segment's length can be defined seperately.

A Sample addressing pattern: $$-$$-$$-####
